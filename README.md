So apparently some a*sholes are profiting off of selling a Hikari toolchain for Xcode 13.1

It hurts me dearly to see someone profiting off an open source software, when all they've done is just compile it. And they don't even thank the author of this software. So now I am sharing the compiled Hikari toolchain for Xcode 13.1 to everyone. 

Have fun

ENJOY IT! BY CTABUYO
